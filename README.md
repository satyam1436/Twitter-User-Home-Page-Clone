# Twitter-User-Home-Page-Clone
This project is a clone of the Twitter user homepage, created using HTML and Tailwind CSS.  It replicates the look and feel of a Twitter profile page with a responsive layout,  profile section, navigation bar, and tweets feed.  Built as a front-end practice project to sharpen UI development skills.
